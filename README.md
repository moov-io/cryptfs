# moov-io/cryptfs
Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

cryptfs implements Go's [`io/fs.FS`](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS) interface for interacting with the local filesystem to transparently encrypt/decrypt files. This is useful as a library because it offers applications a well tested routine for keeping data protected.

## Project Status

cryptfs is included in multiple open-source projects Moov offers and is used in production environments. Please star the project if you are interested in its progress. If you find any bugs or desire additional encryption/encoding algorithms we would appreciate an issue or pull request. Thanks!

## Usage

Cryptfs supports AES and GPG for encryption and Base64 (Standard Raw) encoding. Currently cryptfs is usable as a Go library in your applications. This needs to be initialized prior to reading or writing any files.

<details>
<summary>AES Cryptor</summary>

```go
key := []byte("1234567812345678")) // insecure key

fsys, err := cryptfs.FromCryptor(cryptfs.NewAESCryptor(key))
if err != nil {
    // do something
}

fsys.SetCoder(cryptfs.Base64()) // optional, default is the raw bytes
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>GPG Cryptor</summary>

```go
fsys, err := cryptfs.FromCryptor(cryptfs.NewGPGCryptorFile(publicKeyPath, privateKeyPath, password))
if err != nil {
    // do something
}

fsys.SetCoder(cryptfs.Base64()) // optional, default is the raw bytes
```

</details>

Once initialized you can perform open/read and write operations.

**Open**
```go
file, err := fsys.Open(path)
if err != nil {
    // do something
}
```

**ReadFile**
```go
plaintext, err := fsys.ReadFile(path)
if err != nil {
    // do something
}
```

**WriteFile**
```go
err := fsys.WriteFile(path, data, 0600)
if err != nil {
    // do something
}
```

## Command Line

Moov offers a [command line tool](./cmd/cryptfs) for using this library as well. It's handy for operational debugging and testing.
